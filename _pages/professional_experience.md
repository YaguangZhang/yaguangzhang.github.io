## Selected Student Comments on Teaching

- 2024\. **Instructor**. *AGR 333 Data Science for Agriculture*.

  - I wanted to thank you for the time and effort spent preparing this lecture for us. I have ADHD, and so oftentimes it is very hard for me to stay focused in class, but your teaching style made this way easier for me.

  - The creativity behind this lesson was fascinating to me, and I have never seen anything quite like it. I don't know what your future career plans are, but I truly think your brain has the capacity to do wonderful things.

  - Thanks again! And keep thinking outside the box! 😊

- 2016\. **Speaker**. *Talks on Introduction to Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)*.

  - The speaker was very articulate and understandable throughout the presentation. The delivery and language used was similar if not better than a native English speaker.

  - You seemed very knowledgably about the topic. You are also very charming. I didn’t see any weaknesses.

  - Knew all the information very well and would be a great TA for this course.

  - Seems very knowledgeable on this course and have good teaching skills.
