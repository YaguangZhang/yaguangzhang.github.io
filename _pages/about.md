Hello, I'm Dr. Yaguang Zhang, a Clinical Assistant Professor at Purdue University in the Department of Agricultural & Biological Engineering (ABE) and the Department of Agricultural Sciences Education & Communication (ASEC).

I earned my Ph.D. and M.Sc. degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Purdue University in 2021 and 2015, respectively, and my B.Eng. degree in Communication Engineering from Tianjin University in 2013. I recently completed a postdoctoral research position in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University from 2021 to 2023.

My research focuses on UAV-aided wireless communication systems, 5G millimeter-wave channel measurement and modeling, intelligent transportation system applications in digital agriculture, proactive road maintenance, and engineering education.

Notably, my work has been funded by organizations such as the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (grant 2012-67021-19404), the Joint Transportation Research Program administered by the Indiana Department of Transportation and Purdue University (projects SPR-3908, SPR-4322, SPR-4521, and SPR-4605), the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research (award 534662), and the National Science Foundation (grant CNS-1642982).

Outside of my academic pursuits, I have a passion for the arts, including drawing, singing, and playing the guitar. I'd also love for you to explore my project [Sing4U](https://www.zyglabs.com/sing4u/). Feel free to connect with meâ€”I'm excited to engage in meaningful discussions and collaborations.
