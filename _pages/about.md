Hi! I'm Yaguang, a postdoc in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University.

I received my Ph.D. and M.Sc. degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Purdue University, USA, in 2021 and 2015, respectively, and my B.Eng. degree in Communication Engineering from Tianjin University, China, in 2013.

My research interests lie in the areas of UAV-aided wireless communication systems, 5G millimeter-wave channel measurement and modeling, intelligent transportation system applications in digital agriculture, proactive road maintenance, and engineering education.

My research has been funded by (but not limited to) the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (grant 2012-67021-19404), the Joint Transportation Research Program administered by the Indiana Department of Transportation and Purdue University (projects SPR-3908, SPR-4322, SPR-4521, and SPR-4605), the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research (award 534662), and the National Science Foundation (grant CNS-1642982).

During my free time, I enjoy drawing, singing, and playing guitar. Make sure to check out my project [Sing4U](https://www.zyglabs.com/sing4u/)!
