Hi! I'm Yaguang, a PhD candidate in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University.

I received my M.Sc. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Purdue University, USA, in 2015, and my B.Eng. degree in Communication Engineering from Tianjin University, China, in 2013.

My research interests lie in the areas of UAV-aided wireless communication systems, 5G millimeter-wave channel measurement and modeling, intelligent transportation system applications in digital agriculture, and engineering education.

My current research is funded by the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research (award 534662) and the NSF (grant CNS-1642982).

During my free time I enjoy drawing, singing and playing guitar. Make sure to check out my personal project [Sing4U](https://www.zyglabs.com/sing4u/).
